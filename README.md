# Spring Security Demo List

![](./doc/imgs/spring.png)

&emsp;This is the Demo and notes I wrote while learning Spring Security. The specific contents are as follows:

- [spring-security-demo1](https://github.com/NingNing0111/spring-security-study/tree/master/spring-security-demo1): This is an example of a simple program that outputs "Hello World".
- [spring-security-demo2](https://github.com/NingNing0111/spring-security-study/tree/master/spring-security-demo2): This is an example of authentication where user information is stored both in-memory and in a database.
- [spring-security-demo3](https://github.com/NingNing0111/spring-security-study/tree/master/spring-security-demo3): This is an example of a front-end and back-end separation based on JWT authentication.

The corresponding notes are as follows:
